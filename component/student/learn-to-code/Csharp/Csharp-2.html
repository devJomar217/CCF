<h2>What is C#?</h2>
<p>C# (pronounced "C sharp") is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft.
     It was introduced in the early 2000s as part of the Microsoft .NET framework 
    and is widely used for developing various types of applications, including desktop applications, 
    web applications, games, and more. </p>
  
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

 <h2>Key features of C# include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Object-Oriented: C# supports object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.</li>
<li>Strongly Typed: C# is a statically-typed language, which means that variable types must be declared explicitly during coding and checked at compile-time for type safety.</li>
<li>Platform Independence: C# code can be executed on different platforms using the .NET framework, making it cross-platform compatible.</li>
<li>Garbage Collection: C# uses automatic memory management through a garbage collector, which helps manage memory allocation and deallocation, reducing the risk of memory leaks.</li>
<li>Extensive Standard Library: C# comes with a rich standard library that provides a wide range of functionalities, making it easier for developers to build applications efficiently.</li>
<li>LINQ (Language Integrated Query): C# supports LINQ, a powerful query language that enables developers to interact with data from various sources, such as databases or collections, in a unified manner.</li>
<li>Asynchronous Programming: C# supports asynchronous programming using the async and await keywords, making it easier to write responsive and scalable applications.</li>
<li>Events and Delegates: C# offers a powerful event handling system using delegates, which allows easy implementation of the observer pattern and event-driven programming.</li>
 
</ul>

<h2>Why Use C#?</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is one of the most popular programming language in the world</li>
<li>It is easy to learn and simple to use</li>
<li>It has a huge community support</li>
<li>C# is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs</li>
<li>As C# is close to C</a>,  C++</a> and  Java</a>, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C# or vice versa</li>
</ul>
