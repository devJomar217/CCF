<h2>What is C++?</h2>
<p>C++ is a powerful and widely used programming language that was developed as an extension of the C programming language. It was created by Bjarne 
  Stroustrup at Bell Laboratories in the early 1980s and is considered one of the most influential and versatile programming languages.</p>


<h2>Key features of Java include:</h2>
<p>Object-oriented: Java follows an object-oriented programming paradigm, which allows developers to organize code into classes and objects, promoting code reusability and modularity</p>
<p>Platform independence: Java code is compiled into an intermediate form known as bytecode, which is then executed by the JVM. This enables Java applications to run on any system with a compatible JVM, making it highly portable.</p>
<p>Robust and secure: Java has strong error-handling and memory management mechanisms, making it more robust and less prone to crashes and memory leaks. Additionally, Java's security features help prevent unauthorized access to resources and protect against malicious code.</p>
<p>Rich standard library: Java comes with a vast standard library that provides many pre-built classes and APIs for common tasks, making development more efficient.</p>
<p>Multithreading support: Java allows developers to create multi-threaded applications, enabling concurrent execution and efficient use of system resources.</p>
<p>Community and ecosystem: Java has a massive and active developer community, which has contributed to a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools, making it easier to build complex applications</p>

<h2>Difference between C and C++</h2>
<p>C++ was developed as an extension of C</a>, and both languages have almost the same syntax.</p>
<p>The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not.</p>
