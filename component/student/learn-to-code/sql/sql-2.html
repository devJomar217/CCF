<p>
  SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a programming language used to 
  communicate with and manage relational databases. SQL is designed to perform various
   tasks related to database management, such as creating, modifying, and querying databases.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data Querying: You can retrieve specific data from a database using SELECT statements. For example, you can retrieve all records from a table or filter data based on certain conditions</li>
  <li>Data Manipulation: SQL allows you to insert, update, and delete data in the database using the INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements, respectively.</li>
  <li>Data Definition: SQL provides commands for creating and managing the structure of databases and their objects, such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints, using statements like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.</li>
  <li>Data Control: SQL allows you to manage access to data by defining permissions and roles to control who can perform specific operations on the database.</li>
</ul>

<h2>SQL is a Standard - BUT....</h2>
<p>Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.</p>
<p>However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as <code class="w3-codespan">
SELECT</code>, <code class="w3-codespan">UPDATE</code>, <code class="w3-codespan">
DELETE</code>, <code class="w3-codespan">INSERT</code>, <code class="w3-codespan">
WHERE</code>) in a similar manner.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Most of the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard!</p>

<h2>Using SQL in Your Web Site</h2>
<p>To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)</li>
  <li>To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP</li>
  <li>To use SQL to get the data you want</li>
  <li>To use HTML / CSS to style the page</li>
</ul>
