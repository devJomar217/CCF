<h2>What You Should Already Know</h2>
<p>PHP is a popular server-side scripting language designed primarily for web development. The name "PHP" 
  originally stood for "Personal Home Page," but it now stands for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor." PHP code is embedded directly into 
  the HTML of a web page, and when a user
   accesses the page, the server processes the PHP code and generates dynamic content that is sent to the user's web browser.</p>
 

<h2>Key features of PHP include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Server-Side Scripting: PHP is executed on the server-side, meaning that the processing of PHP code takes place on the web server rather than in the user's web browser. This allows for dynamic content generation before sending the final output to the user.</li> 
<li>Open Source: PHP is an open-source language, which means it is freely available and has a large community of developers contributing to its development and improvement.</li>
<li>Cross-Platform: PHP is a cross-platform language, making it compatible with various operating systems such as Windows, macOS, Linux, and more.</li>
<li>Integration with Databases: PHP has built-in support for various databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite, and others, enabling easy interaction with database systems to store and retrieve data.</li> 
<li>Extensive Library Support: PHP offers a vast collection of built-in functions and libraries that make it easier to perform common tasks, such as handling form data, working with files, manipulating images, and more.</li> 
<li>Scalability: PHP is suitable for building both small and large-scale applications, making it a popular choice for websites ranging from simple blogs to complex e-commerce platforms and social networking sites.</li> 
<li>Easy to Learn: PHP is relatively easy to learn, especially for developers with prior experience in programming languages like C, C++, or JavaScript.</li> 
<li>Community Support: PHP has a large and active community of developers, providing abundant resources, documentation, and online support for beginners and experienced developers alike.</li>
