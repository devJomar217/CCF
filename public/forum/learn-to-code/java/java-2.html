    <h2>What is Java?</h2>
    <p>
        Java is a widely used and popular programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems
        in the mid-1990s. It is designed to be platform-independent, meaning that Java code can run on various
         operating systems and devices without modification, thanks to the "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) principle. 
         This is achieved through the use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which acts as an abstraction layer between the 
         Java code and the underlying hardware and operating system.</p>
 


         <h2>Key features of Java include:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Object-oriented: Java follows an object-oriented programming
             paradigm, which allows developers to organize code into classes and objects, 
             promoting code reusability and modularity</li>
        <li>Platform independence: Java code is compiled into an intermediate form known as bytecode, 
            which is then executed by the JVM. This enables Java
             applications to run on any system with a compatible JVM, making it highly portable.</li>
        <li>Robust and secure: Java has strong error-handling and memory management mechanisms, making it more robust 
            and less prone to crashes and memory leaks. Additionally, 
            Java's security features help prevent unauthorized access to resources and protect against malicious code.</li>
        <li>Rich standard library: Java comes with a vast standard library that 
            provides many pre-built classes and APIs for common tasks, making development more efficient</li>
        <li>Multithreading support: Java allows developers to create multi-threaded applications,
             enabling concurrent execution and efficient use of system resources.</li>
        <li>Community and ecosystem: Java has a massive and active developer community, which has contributed to a vast 
            ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools, making it easier to build complex applications</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Use Java?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)</li>
        <li>It is one of the most popular programming language in the world</li>
        <li>It has a large demand in the current job market</li>
        <li>It is easy to learn and simple to use</li>
        <li>It is open-source and free</li>
        <li>It is secure, fast and powerful</li>
        <li>It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)</li>
        <li>Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs</li>
        <li>As Java is close to  C++</a> and  C#</a>, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa</li>
    </ul>
